                    <h2>a quick summary of everything</h2>
                    <li>my beautiful partner is studying coding so I am tempted to play around with it too</li>
                    <li>I am also currently playing around with The Longing (a neat little game that spans 400 days and no more)</li>
                    <li>my partner and I though are playing Spacelines From the Far Out & Castle Crashers, and both games are an absolute joy</li>
                    <li>I like crying & feel good shows like The Good Place, or Superstore</li>
                    <li>but my partner and I are actually watching Better Call Saul and Star Trek Discovery right now, so it's a change of pace</li>
                    <li>and last but not least, I am trying to make my way through The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy!</li>
